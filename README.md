## Simple 3D Chess

## A simple (and not complete) 3D chess game using JavaScript and Three.js, can play with another players

### Overview
This simple 3D chess game is made for a university project. It uses the Three.js framework (and also Threex.DomEvents) to run a 3D environment over a web HTML page. It is entirely coded in JavaScript, and the models are made with Blender. The game is multiplayer (no opponent AI) and don't includes all the rules (for example, the king's moves are not validated). The game ends when a player captures the opponent's king.
### How to use
You had to start **start.py**, that is a simple Web Server written in Python in order to make the resources available to the main script. When the local server page has loaded, just open the HTML page **chess.html** (JavaScript and a WebGL supporting PC are required). During the game, you can rotate the view with Right Arrow and Left Arrow.
